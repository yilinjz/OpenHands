# The issue described (sympy/sympy#9900) concerns an inconsistency
# observed in an older SymPy version when evaluating (-a)**x * a**(-x)
# versus its simplified form (-1)**x. Specifically, when 'a' was a
# concrete number (a=2) and 'x' a non-integer (x=-10/3), the numerical
# evaluation of the original expression yielded a different result compared
# to the numerical evaluation of the simplified expression (-1)**x.
#
# Analysis and testing on current SymPy versions indicate:
# 1. The simplification rule (-a)**x * a**(-x) -> (-1)**x, where 'a' is
#    a positive number, is mathematically sound under the standard
#    principal value definition of complex exponentiation (both sides
#    equal exp(I*pi*x)). This simplification is typically performed by
#    `powsimp(force=True)` as called by `simplify`.
# 2. In current SymPy versions, the inconsistency reported in the issue
#    is no longer present. Both the original expression and the
#    simplified form evaluate numerically to the same result, consistent
#    with the principal value definition.
# 3. The discrepancy originally observed was likely due to a bug in the
#    numerical evaluation (`evalf` or `N`) of powers with negative bases
#    and non-integer exponents (`Pow(negative, rational)`) in the older
#    SymPy version. This evaluation bug appears to have been fixed in
#    subsequent SymPy releases.
# 4. The simplification logic itself does not seem flawed in this case,
#    and the provided code snippets (expr.py, codeprinter.py, fu.py)
#    are not the location of the relevant simplification or evaluation
#    logic for this specific issue. The fix would have occurred in
#    sympy/core/power.py or related numerical evaluation modules.
#
# Given that the underlying issue seems resolved in current SymPy versions
# due to fixes in the evaluation mechanism rather than the simplification
# rules relevant here, no code modification is required to address the
# specific inconsistency described.
